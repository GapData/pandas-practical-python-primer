# PyCharm Purchases
It's time to think about your purchase of PyCharm.
Go over the different options with the class.

# Review Homework

# Credentials & Cloud-Based Source Code Control
Talk about the importance of not ever, **ever** having usernames/passwords
in your code files.  Always keep them in the environment or configuration files.

# Exception Handling
- Each possible section and their uses:
    - `try`
    - `except`
    - `else`
    - `finally`
    
# 3rd Party Libraries
- `requirements.txt`
- `pip` or PyCharm interface: Another reason to go through the pain of 
remote interpreter setup.
