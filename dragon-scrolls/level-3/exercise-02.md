## Exercise 2: Basic Housekeeping
There are few things we'll need to do before we get started.  You've done them
all before, so it should be easy to get these done:
- Use `pip` to install `requests` and then `freeze` it into your 
`requirements.txt` file.
- Create a new module in your `dragon-warrior/[your_id]` package called
`github_api.py`.
- Add a docstring to the module, import requests, and add the standard
way of designating that this script will be execute directly.  Remember, 
it starts with `if __name__ ==`.
