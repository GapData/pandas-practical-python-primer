- [Setup a new project in PyCharm](../level-0/pycharm-project-setup.md).

## Training Topics
### Building a Basic Web Service in Python
* There are a number of libraries/frameworks available to build web services in
Python.  The two most popular are [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fflask.pocoo.org%2F&ei=jwyYVdihJ4b0tQW5jbr4Dg&usg=AFQjCNHCF6gYMbnkUKtJl-u3lzTeLt-61A&bvm=bv.96952980,d.b2w).
* We will be using Flask (it's easier to get started with) to build a simple
API that allows use to list, create, update, and even delete a list of our
friends.

### Enhancing our Friends API
* After we get our basic functionality up and running, we'll make some
enhancements to our API that would standard features of a real-world program:
    * A database to hold our friendship info so that it persists between
    program runs.
    * Some sort of authentication requirement so that random people (or 
    machines!) can't change your list of friends.
